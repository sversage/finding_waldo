# finding_waldo

Small project to find Waldo in an image leveraging the OpenCV library. Project was inspired by the blog machine learning mastery.

This particular implementation takes the picture of waldo and searches the entire image for images that match the small waldo label. Further work would need to be put into the code in order to find Waldo in another image in which he's facing a different direction, etc.
